# Coding Task

Your primary task is to build an app to retrieve weather information from a public weather API(https://rapidapi.com/weatherbit/api/weather/endpoints).

In this task, as in our business, performance, security and good code practices are key. It would be great if the architecture
of the application reflected these constraints.
The app should have 2 pages:

- The first page should give me the current weather for one of the below locations

- The second page should give me the weather extended(16 days) forcast for the locations below.
  This page also should give me a search area where I can filter the results down by:
  _ Min Temperature, where the results should match any min temperature lower or equals than the value provided
  _ Max Temperature, where the results should match any max temperature higher or equals than the value provided

Locations: (London, New York, Mumbai, Sydney, Tokyo)

## Requirements

- React and Typescript must be used
- A README file should be supplied to explain how to run the application and any other information
  relating to the code that you feel would be valuable to share. Please try to add as much detail as you can.
- The application should be responsive (desktop, tablet and mobile).

## Notes

- Feel free to choose the technologies/tools/Frameworks you want to choose.
- The focus should be on the quality of the source code.
- It may be easier to give us a link to a git repo when you're done, otherwise a compressed git archive would be fine.
- The front end should be simple, no need for elaborate UI,
  a simple display of some data in a creative way will suffice.
